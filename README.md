Important notes:
  - Don't push to MAIN, select a branch to push. This avoids any errors.
    
  - Push = Commit, not to a relationship commit but a yea ts good to push.
      - Good Example: git commit -m "Added Footer Layout"
      - bad Example : git commit -m "box thing to fix"
        
  - Difference between push and Pull
      - Push : upload your code/woprk to github
      - Pull : Download the code/work or the latest changes
        
  - Merge(kingdom)
      - We cross this bridge when we come to it cause idk much about it
        
  - Branches
      - Everyone create your own branch like " git checkout -b FEATURE_YOURNAME "
        
  - My suggested folder format would be:
    /src
      /pages
      /components
      /pages
    index.html
    style.css
    script.js
    frameworkthing

  - Important reminders
      - git pull origin dev  : Pulls the latest code(suggested to do this before starting to code)
      - git add .            : Selects files for saving
      - git commit           : Saves smapshot
      - git push             : Uploadfs snapcshot
